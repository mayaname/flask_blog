# Flask - Happy Hovel Micro-Blog

## Description

This is a micro-blog application loosely based the Flask Mega Tutorial series by Miguel Grinberg and several other tutorials. I have modified the application structure to suit my preferences, but still avoid circular import. As I am still learning about Flask, I plan to use the blog as a journal of sorts for short posts on Flask topics I find useful. It is my hope that others will also find these of use.
