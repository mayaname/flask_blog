 <h2>Description</h2>

 <p>
    This is a stripped down version of a micro-blog/journal application loosely based on the 2024 version of 
    the Flask Mega Tutorial series by Miguel Grinberg and several other tutorials. You can view code for the
    complete version of the application on GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have modified the application structure to suit my preferences, but still avoid circular imports. 
    As I am still learning about Flask, I am using this app as a journal of sorts for short posts on 
    Flask topics I find useful. I will also try to address some of the issues I encountered when deploying 
    to PythonAnywhere. While these are mostly for my reference, it is my hope that others will also find 
    them along with the application code of some use.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes from Flask Mega Tutorial</h2>

  <p>Here is where I deviated from the FMT</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defined extensions like SQLAlchemy, Flash-Login, and Flask-Migrate in extensions.py</li>
    <li>Used standard CSS rather than Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Added Script to dismiss flash notification after 30 seconds in main.js</li>
    <li>Added Script to show/hide login password in login.js</li>
    <li>Defined post column in Post class to support larger text content (more journal like)</li>
    <li>Used a somewhat different code for errors.py to support common error.html file</li>
    <li>Used modified code from SendGrid for logging and password reset emails</li>
    <li>Changed index route to not require login, shows all journal entries in descending order</li>
    <li>Changed User profile page shows both user and following entries in descending order</li>
    <li>Moved the Add Journal Entry link to the User profile page</li>
    <li>Use Bleach and Markupsafe modules to securely allow formatting of post body content</li>
    <li>Used Babel to translation to German rather than Spanish</li>
    <li>Used googletrans as no credit card is required, Display entire translated post on separate page</li>
    <li>Used SQLAlchemy for navbar search form that searches the entry titles</li>
    <li>Added author mini-profiles (no journal entries) that are not restricted by login requirement</li>
    <li>Updated the author (user) mini-profile to be a modal popup</li>
    <li>Added an About page</li>


  </ul>

  <h2>Abnormally Normal's History</h2>

  <P>
    Abnormally Normal started over fifteen years ago when I took an online web development course through 
    John Hopkins University. A capstone project was to create a website for a fictitious customer. 
    Abnormally Normal became the fictitious web design company for the project. From this humble beginning,
    the 'company' created numerous project sites through the years for courses from Rice University, MIT, University of Michigan, 
    and many others. It is also used for personal projects such as this one.
